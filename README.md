SI lie here with the maggots
Waiting for the rain
Covered in ash and dirt
I never seem to learn
Come wash it all away
I can't change what I won’t admit
I can’t remember if I won’t forget

So pull the skin back from my bones
Annihilate me
Come nail me to my throne
Crown my head in shame
Covered in ash and dirt
I never seem to learn
Come nail me to my throne
I'm the king of suffering

I’ve tried to break the habit
I’ve learned to love the pain
And I can’t change what I won’t admit
I feel the vicious cycle start again

So pull the skin back from my bones
Annihilate me
Come nail me to my throne
Crown my head in shame
Covered in ash and dirt
I never seem to learn
Come nail me to my throne
I'm the king of suffering

Annihilate me
Annihilate me
Annihilate me

So pull the skin back from my bones
Annihilate me
Come nail me to my throne
Crown my head in shame
Covered in ash and dirt
I never fucking learn
Come nail me to my throne
I'm the king of suffering

Annihilate me
Annihilate me
Annihilate me
I'm the king of suffering
